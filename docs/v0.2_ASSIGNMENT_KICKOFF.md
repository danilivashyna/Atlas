## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: What if I break existing tests?
**A**: Don't panic! Run `pytest -q` to see what broke. Usually, the error message tells you exactly what went wrong. Look for:
- API changes (if you changed function signature)
- Import issues (if you renamed/moved files)
- Missing dependencies

Fix it, commit, push, and run again.

### Q: How do I handle dependencies?
**A**: Check `requirements.txt` for the list. If your feature needs a new package:
1. Check if it's already listed
2. If not, add it to `requirements.txt`
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Commit `requirements.txt` with your feature

### Q: What if my feature takes longer than expected?
**A**: That's normal! Keep pushing progress commits so the team knows you're working on it:
```bash
git commit -m "wip(v0.2-0X): Work in progress - implementing X part"
git push origin feature/v0.2-0X-*
```

The PR is still draft, so no pressure for it to be perfect yet.

### Q: Can I skip some tests initially?
**A**: Yes, use `@pytest.mark.skip` for tests you'll implement later:
```python
@pytest.mark.skip(reason="Will implement in v0.2.1")
def test_advanced_feature():
    pass
```

But try to keep skipped count low. Check brief for minimum test count.

### Q: How do I avoid conflicts with other developers?
**A**: Each developer works on a separate branch, so conflicts are rare. If merging to main:
1. Your feature branch is independent
2. Only merge after approval (gh pr merge)
3. Main branch stays stable (all tests passing)

If you need code from another feature, wait for their PR to merge first.

### Q: What if I need to update my branch with latest main?
**A**:
```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
# If conflicts: git rebase --continue after fixing
git push -f origin feature/v0.2-0X-*
```

Or simpler: just PR ‚Üí main, GitHub will tell you about conflicts.

### Q: When should I request review?
**A**: When:
- All your tests pass locally: `pytest -q`
- No new warnings: `pytest -q 2>&1 | grep -i warning` (empty output = good)
- PR is converted to ready: `gh pr ready <N>`
- You've self-reviewed your code

Then: `gh pr edit <N> --add-reviewer danilivashyna`

## üö® Common Pitfalls & Fixes

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError` in tests | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| `DeprecationWarning` in output | Update code to use current API, check CHANGELOG |
| Test passes locally but fails in CI | Run full test suite: `pytest -q` (not just your test) |
| PR shows conflicts with main | Rebase: `git rebase origin/main` + `git push -f` |
| Can't push (permission denied) | Check SSH keys: `ssh -T git@github.com` |
| Forgot to switch branch | Check: `git branch` (shows current with `*`) |
| Accidentally committed to main | Use `git reflog` to recover + cherry-pick to correct branch |

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Commit frequently**: Small commits are easier to review and debug
2. **Write descriptive messages**: `git commit -m "feat(v0.2-05): Add Distiller.step() with KL loss"` is better than "update"
3. **Use `pytest -x` flag**: Stops on first failure, saves time
4. **Check PR status before pushing**: `gh pr view <N>` to see current state
5. **Read error messages carefully**: They usually tell you exactly what's wrong
6. **Test both locally and in CI**: Local tests pass != CI passes (different environment)
7. **Ask for help early**: Better to ask than block for days

## üìû Getting Help

**If you're stuck:**

1. **Check the brief again**: 90% of answers are there
2. **Look at test failures**: The error message usually tells you what's wrong
3. **Check existing code**: Look at v0.2-01 & v0.2-02 skeleton for patterns
4. **Comment in PR**: Leave a comment with your question, maintainer will respond
5. **Check GitHub Issues**: Your feature has an Issue (#14-21), can discuss there too
6. **Slack/Email team**: For urgent blockers

---

## ‚ú® Success Criteria (Per Feature)

After you're done, your PR should:

- ‚úÖ Have all tests passing: `pytest -q` shows 0 failures
- ‚úÖ Have no new warnings: `pytest -q 2>&1 | grep -i warning` is empty
- ‚úÖ Be converted to ready: status shows "Ready for review" not "Draft"
- ‚úÖ Have description filled out: Goal, Scope, Acceptance, How to Test
- ‚úÖ Have all acceptance criteria met: As per your task brief
- ‚úÖ Have been reviewed: Maintainer approved + merged or requested changes

Then it's ready to merge! üéâ
