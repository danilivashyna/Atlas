# Model Card: Atlas Semantic Space

## Model Details

### Model Description

Atlas is a 5-dimensional semantic space encoder-decoder system designed for interpretable text representation. It compresses text into a structured 5D space where each dimension captures a distinct semantic property, and provides explanations for its decoding decisions.

- **Developed by**: danilivashyna
- **Model type**: Semantic space encoder-decoder
- **Language(s)**: Russian (ru), English (en) - multilingual support
- **License**: MIT
- **Repository**: https://github.com/danilivashyna/Atlas
- **Version**: 0.1.0
- **Release Date**: 2025-01-19

### Model Architecture

**Current Implementation (MVP - v0.1.0):**
- **Encoder**: Simple rule-based encoder using character and word features
  - Dimensionality: 5D output space
  - Input: UTF-8 text strings (any length)
  - Output: Normalized 5D vectors (values in [-1, 1])

- **Decoder**: Interpretable decoder with reasoning
  - Generates text from 5D vectors
  - Provides dimension-level explanations
  - Uses predefined vocabulary and semantic mappings

**Planned Enhancements (v0.2+):**
- Transformer-based encoder (BERT/multilingual models)
- Neural decoder with attention mechanisms
- Learned disentanglement via regularization
- Fine-tuned on domain-specific data

### 5 Semantic Dimensions

| Dimension | Semantic Poles | Description | Range |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| dim₁ | Object ↔ Action | Grammatical structure (noun vs verb orientation) | [-1, 1] |
| dim₂ | Positive ↔ Negative | Emotional tone and sentiment | [-1, 1] |
| dim₃ | Abstract ↔ Concrete | Level of conceptual abstraction | [-1, 1] |
| dim₄ | I ↔ World | Point of observation (first-person vs external) | [-1, 1] |
| dim₅ | Living ↔ Mechanical | Essential nature (animate vs inanimate) | [-1, 1] |

**Note**: These interpretations are intended design goals. In the current MVP, dimensions are determined by rule-based heuristics. In future versions, dimensions will emerge from data through disentanglement training.

## Intended Use

### Primary Use Cases

1. **Semantic Exploration**: Understanding how concepts relate in semantic space
2. **Interpretability Research**: Studying how meaning can be decomposed into dimensions
3. **Educational Tool**: Teaching concepts of semantic spaces and dimensionality
4. **Prototyping**: Building applications that require interpretable text representations

### Intended Users

- Researchers in NLP and interpretable AI
- Developers building semantic search or analysis tools
- Educators teaching computational linguistics
- Anyone interested in understanding semantic representations

## How It Works

### Encoding Process

```python
text = "Собака"
vector = encoder.encode_text(text)
# Result: [-0.46, 0.0, 0.46, 0.0, 0.46]
```

The encoder analyzes text features:
- Character composition (vowels, consonants)
- Word length and structure
- Semantic categories (derived from text properties)
- Emotional tone (basic sentiment analysis)

### Decoding Process

```python
vector = [0.1, 0.9, -0.5, 0.2, 0.8]
result = decoder.decode(vector, with_reasoning=True)
```

The decoder:
1. Maps each dimension to semantic properties
2. Combines dimensions to select appropriate text
3. Explains which dimensions contributed most
4. Provides human-readable reasoning

## Limitations

### Current Limitations (v0.1.0)

1. **Rule-Based**: Current implementation uses heuristics, not learned representations
2. **Limited Vocabulary**: Decoder has a constrained vocabulary
3. **Language Coverage**: Best for Russian and English; other languages less tested
4. **No Context**: Processes individual words/phrases, not full documents
5. **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same output (no stochasticity)

### Conceptual Limitations

1. **Dimension Interpretability**: Dimensions may not always align perfectly with intended semantics
2. **Cultural Bias**: Semantic associations may reflect cultural assumptions
3. **Ambiguity**: Multiple meanings of words not fully captured in 5D space
4. **Compression Loss**: 5D representation cannot capture all nuances of meaning

### Technical Limitations

1. **Performance**:
   - Current: Basic Python, CPU-only
   - Target (v0.1): p50 < 50ms, p95 < 150ms
   - Current performance: Not yet benchmarked

2. **Memory**:
   - Current: < 100MB (no neural models)
   - Target: ≤ 1GB for MVP with neural models

3. **Scalability**:
   - Designed for single texts/small batches
   - Not optimized for large-scale batch processing

## Training Data (Future Versions)

### Planned Data Sources

For neural versions (v0.2+), we plan to use:

1. **Multilingual Corpora**:
   - Common Crawl (filtered)
   - Wikipedia dumps (ru, en)
   - OpenSubtitles
   - News corpora

2. **Data Volume** (planned):
   - Training: ~10M sentence pairs
   - Validation: ~100K pairs
   - Test: ~10K pairs

3. **Data Filtering**:
   - Remove profanity and offensive content
   - Filter PII (personal identifiable information)
   - Deduplicate
   - Quality filtering (length, language detection)

### Current Version (v0.1.0)

- No training data (rule-based)
- Vocabulary: Hand-curated (~100 Russian words)
- No dataset biases (no ML training)

## Evaluation

### Metrics (Planned for v0.1)

#### Performance Metrics
- **Latency**:
  - encode/decode/explain: p50 < 50ms, p95 < 150ms (target)
  - Current: Not benchmarked
- **Memory**: ≤ 1GB process memory (target)

#### Quality Metrics (Planned)
- **BLEU Score**: Baseline comparison for decode quality
- **Dim-Coherence@k**: Topic coherence for dimension interpretations
- **Counterfactual Consistency**: Predictable changes when varying dimensions
- **Stability (ARI/NMI)**: Consistency of clusterings across runs
- **Human Evaluation**: Likert scale ratings (1-5), inter-annotator agreement

### Current Evaluation

- **Unit Tests**: 29 tests passing (dimensions, encoder, decoder, space)
- **Consistency**: Deterministic encoding/decoding verified
- **Reasoning**: Dimension explanations generated correctly

### Benchmarks (To Be Added)

- Golden sample tests (regression testing)
- Performance benchmarks (latency, throughput)
- Interpretability metrics (coherence, stability)
- Human evaluation protocol

## Ethical Considerations

### Potential Risks

1. **Bias Amplification**: Semantic associations may reflect societal biases
2. **Misuse**: Could be used to analyze private communications without consent
3. **Overreliance**: Users might trust dimension interpretations too much
4. **Cultural Assumptions**: 5D decomposition reflects specific cultural perspectives

### Mitigations

1. **Transparency**: Full disclosure of how dimensions are determined
2. **Privacy**: No logging of raw user text by default
3. **Documentation**: Clear communication of limitations
4. **Ephemeral Mode**: Option to process without persistence
5. **Open Source**: Allows community scrutiny and improvement

### Out-of-Scope Use Cases

❌ **Do Not Use For**:
- Medical diagnosis or healthcare decisions
- Legal decisions or law enforcement
- Financial advice or credit scoring
- Surveillance or privacy invasion
- Generating harmful content
- Any safety-critical applications

## Performance and Reproducibility

### Determinism

- **Random Seeds**: Fixed seeds for any stochastic operations (future versions)
- **Versioning**: Explicit version tags for tokenizers and dependencies
- **Checksums**: SHA-256 hashes for model checkpoints (future versions)
- **Environment**: Python version, dependency versions locked

### Reproducibility Checklist

- [x] Code is version controlled (Git)
- [x] Dependencies specified (requirements.txt, setup.py)
- [ ] Random seeds documented and fixed (planned for neural versions)
- [ ] Model checkpoints with SHA-256 hashes (planned)
- [ ] Evaluation data frozen with versioning (planned)
